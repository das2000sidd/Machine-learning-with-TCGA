# Machine-learning-with-TCGA
This is an ongoing project to apply machine learning to TCGA transcriptomic data to build a classifier and find contributing genes. 
As of now, the download of transcriptomic data done using TCGAbiolinks package and differential expression run using DESEq2 to find genes differentiating the various cancer groups. A PCA plot was also generated and a dendogram to check clustering of cancer groups.
A random forest and gradient boosting model was run and variable improtance value generated.
